# musicplayer
React component to play audio. Using React Hooks.

With the announcement of Hooks in React framework, we built a Component to check out the new features of Hooks e.g. useState(), useEffects() and useReducer(). 

This component mimics the minimal behavior of HTML5 AUDIO tag. It works with React 16.7.0 alpha and CDN versions of the React JS files.

Pre-requisite : Please download the sound file from http://www.music.helsinki.fi/tmt/opetus/uusmedia/esim/a2002011001-e02.wav. 

musicplayer.html is the starting point. For JSX, it makes use of Babel transpiler from the CDN link.
